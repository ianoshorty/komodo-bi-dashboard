# Plan Of Action

As this is a R&D / internal project, this POA is rather light.

>Who you will need support from, and by when, and in relation to what.

At present, this is an R&D project, so no external support is needed.

>Details of technology choice (e.g. PHP, Node, React etc), and sensible justification for use. 

Node, AWS, React etc. A mind map of technologies is at https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/d84f6e5d-91fd-49e4-823c-66a289c5f72c 

>Top level frameworks / libraries you intend to employ to address requirements

>How you will handle testing? What testing frameworks will be put in place? What will be tested? What kind of test coverage are we going for? What needs to be manually tested vs what will be automated?

Jest. Routes, actions and frontend.

None at present, TBC.

>What project documentation is needed? Where will it be stored?

Docs folder. Lessons for the most part.

>What measures of code quality control will be placed upon the project?

 - Eslint
 - Prettier
 - CodeClimate
 - Danger

>How will the project utilise CI/CD process?

 - CircleCI

>Who in the project will take responsbility for what aspects?

 - For now, Ian.

How will you measure success on the project? Are there any relevant technical KPIS?

 - A working dashboard, able to track 3 types of KPI - timed, total and boundary.
 - Creation of useful lessons for video

Any outstanding known unknowns or questions for follow up.

 - Right now, TBC
